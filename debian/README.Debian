Sylpheed for Debian
-------------------

1. Helpers and tools
--------------------

There are some useful tools for users of this package. These tools 
were from the sylpheed-claws package, later renamed to claws-mail
and are now available in the claws-mail-tools package, but not 
installed by default.
Once installed, they can be found on /usr/share/doc/claws-mail/tools, 
please read the README file found in this directory for information
on how to use the tools and what they are for.

To create a X-Face you have to use the gif2xface script. You need
to install compface and netpbm for the script to work. Read 
/usr/share/doc/claws-mail/tools/README to learn how to use it.

2. External editor encoding issues
----------------------------------

Editing with a external editor can cause loss of data by mangling encoding of
non-ASCII chars, as described in http://bugs.debian.org/326073

To avoid that the best option is to use an UTF-8 locale for the system. 
Using the local encoding in the external editor is also possible. 

See author's response for this at:

3. Alternatives
---------------

Sylpheed is not a Sylpheed Claws nor Claws Mail alternative now because of 
the filtering rules differences between both versions which can lead to user
confusion and possibly (rules) data loss in case of a user trying claws and 
then main. Anyway files are still there in hope of a future rules format 
unification for both applications.

4. Automatic new version check
------------------------------

There's now an option to check periodically over the network if a new 
Sylpheed version has been released upstream. This option is ENABLED by 
default, so if you're running a stable version it may be a bit nagging.

To disable it go "Configuration" menu, "Common preferences" option,
"Details" tab, "Update" tab, uncheck "Enable auto update check".

On the other hand it can be useful for unstable/testing users to remind
the lazy maintainer about packaging new versions when they're available ;-)
